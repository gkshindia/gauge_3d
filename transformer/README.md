# Transformer Enhancement - Phase 3

This module implements the transformer enhancement phase of the Gauge 3D pipeline, providing advanced point cloud processing capabilities using P4Transformer.

## Overview

The transformer enhancement phase takes the 4D Gaussians generated in Phase 2 and enhances them through:

1. **Point Cloud Extraction** - Extract high-quality point clouds from 4D Gaussians
2. **P4Transformer Integration** - Use P4Transformer for advanced point cloud processing 
3. **Enhancement Pipeline** - Apply denoising, completion, and feature enhancement
4. **Reconstruction Pipeline** - Convert enhanced point clouds back to optimized Gaussians

## Components

### Point Cloud Extractor (`point_cloud_extractor.py`)
Extracts temporal point cloud sequences from 4D Gaussians with quality metrics and temporal consistency checks.

### P4Transformer Integration (`p4transformer_integration.py`)
Integrates the P4Transformer model for advanced point cloud enhancement, including model loading, preprocessing, and batch processing.

### Enhancement Pipeline (`enhancement_pipeline.py`)
Applies various enhancement techniques:
- Point cloud denoising
- Completion of missing regions
- Feature enhancement
- Temporal consistency enforcement

### Reconstruction Pipeline (`reconstruction_pipeline.py`)
Converts enhanced point clouds back to 4D Gaussians:
- Point cloud to Gaussian conversion
- Re-optimization of Gaussian parameters
- Iterative refinement
- Quality assessment

## Configuration

Configuration files are stored in the `config/` directory:
- `transformer_config.yaml` - Main transformer settings
- `p4transformer_config.yaml` - P4Transformer model configuration
- `enhancement_config.yaml` - Enhancement pipeline parameters

## Usage

```python
from transformer import (
    PointCloudExtractor,
    P4TransformerIntegration,
    EnhancementPipeline,
    ReconstructionPipeline
)

# Extract point clouds from 4D Gaussians
extractor = PointCloudExtractor()
point_clouds = extractor.extract_from_gaussians(gaussian_data)

# Enhance using P4Transformer
p4transformer = P4TransformerIntegration()
enhanced_clouds = p4transformer.enhance(point_clouds)

# Apply enhancement pipeline
enhancer = EnhancementPipeline()
refined_clouds = enhancer.process(enhanced_clouds)

# Reconstruct enhanced Gaussians
reconstructor = ReconstructionPipeline()
enhanced_gaussians = reconstructor.reconstruct(refined_clouds)
```

## Dependencies

- PyTorch (for neural networks)
- Open3D (for point cloud processing)
